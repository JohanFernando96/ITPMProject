            Mid-latitude cyclones, sometimes called extratropical cyclones, form
            at the polar front when the temperature difference between two air
            masses is large. These air masses blow past each other in opposite
            directions. Coriolis Effect deflects winds to the right in the
            Northern Hemisphere, causing the winds to strike the polar front at
            an angle. Warm and cold fronts form next to each other. Most winter
            storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United States
            and Europe, are caused by mid-latitude cyclones.The warm air at the
            cold front rises and creates a low pressure cell. Winds rush into
            the low pressure and create a rising column of air. The air twists,
            rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise
            in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the rising air is moist, rain or
            snow falls. Mid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the
            mid-latitudes and move eastward with the westerly winds. These two-
            to five-day storms can reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles)
            in diameter and produce winds up to 125 km (75 miles) per hour. Like
            tropical cyclones, they can cause extensive beach erosion and
            flooding.
